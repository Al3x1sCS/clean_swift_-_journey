# Clean Swift - Journey

This repository is a study journal for learning and experimenting with the Clean Swift architecture. It includes a variety of projects that demonstrate how to use the Clean Swift architecture to build different types of iOS applications.

## What is Clean Swift?

Clean Swift is an architecture pattern for iOS development, created by Raymond Law. It is based on the VIP cycle (View, Interactor, Presenter, and Router) and follows the SOLID principles. The goal of Clean Swift is to create a maintainable and scalable codebase for iOS projects.

## Projects

- **Project 1:** A simple To-Do list app that will try to follow SOLID best practices and the Clean Swift architecture to build a basic iOS application.
- **Project 2:** A weather app showing and trying to follow SOLID best practices and the Clean Swift architecture to build a more complex iOS app with network requests and data analysis.
- **Project 3:** A social media app that will try to follow SOLID best practices and the Clean Swift architecture to build a large-scale iOS application with multiple screens and advanced features.

## Requirements
- Swift 5.0 or higher
- Xcode 12 or higher

## Resources

- [Clean Swift Website](https://clean-swift.com/)
- [Clean Swift GitHub](https://github.com/Clean-Swift/CleanStore)

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to this study journal, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.

## Notes
- This repository is public and everyone is welcome to contribute with comments, suggestions and improvements.
- The projects are organized in a logical order, allowing me to build my knowledge over time.
- This repository will be modified several times until I find all the concepts I have to study to learn Clean Swift so expect drastic changes, especially in this first moment where I'm studying the basics of Clean Swift.
